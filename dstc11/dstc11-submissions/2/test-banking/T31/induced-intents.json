And do you guys have any fees for international charges?", "OK. And I asked you a question, is there a fee for any of these transactions?", "Well let's see. How much did she charge? Oh that was about sixty-eight dollars.", "not that I know of. is there like a daily limit as far as what we can withdraw?", "I don't think so. Does it show that it's a membership fee or a subscription fee?", "I really can't think of anything. Oh is there any fees associated with doing this?", "Yes I had a concern, by chance is there a monthly fee and if so, how can I avoid it?", "Oh, absolutely, and just to check it and see would there be any charge for doing this?", "Well if I do that are there gonna be an any fees, do you have a fee for online banking?", "And then, who's going to take care of that thousand dollars in Walmart? Am I paying that?", "Oh well I'm only going to send her a hundred dollars. So what will that fee be for for me?", "OK. I believe I take the ones that closest to me. is there a fee for that? Transaction fee?", "And so so so if I were to dispute this, do I have to pay any fee now? and how long will it take?", "Thank you for letting me know that, because I was going to ask was there extra fees or for that.", "first of all, how much will will I be charged for such an amount? As in, what what are the rates?", "OK. Oh. Oh yeah, and by the way can I cancel a cheque online? Or or or or is there a fee for that?", "That is absurd. Why should I have to pay a fee? No. You need to see if you can waive that. I'm not.", "That's awfully steep. Is there a, a cheaper way of doing this? That's faster, or, just some other way?", "Well, that's not very much and I believe I'm being charged a fee each month just to have that account.", "No mam. No one else has access and I have no subscriptions. What are the next steps to resolve this problem?", "OK and the the one that's closest to me walking distance is there any fees transaction fees that I have to do?", "OK, and no one's putting a hold on it right? Like am I gonna get taxed or like investigated for that much money?", "OK, that's fine. Cuz if this is a subscription I wanna make sure that I'm not charged again like this next month.", "I was wondering if you could tell me whether I will have any additional fees. Will I owe anything more to you guys?", "OK, will that charge? Will y'all charge me for that or is that free of charge cuz I'm a customer? How does that work?", "Oh, oh! And and can you also like find out what's the limit on there? Cuz I have to pay like, you know, two months worth.", "yes that's acceptable. Maybe transfer a little bit more then to compensate for that fee. How much did you say it was again?", "I have some questions. Is there a fee I have to pay for international wire transfers? And if there is a fee, how much is it?", "We're looking at a week here to get my ninety. this is this is ridiculous. I didn't make this charge. I want my money back now.", "Well this is ridiculous. You guys have raised your fees more than once this year. I'm not paying for this. I wanna close my accounts.", "I don't. Six months of free? No, I don't need No. It's not in the question. I just need the fee waived. I've been a customer long enough.", "This one seems to be good. I was just does does this have any fees? Like per dollar amount is there a certain amount that they're gonna ask for?", "But it is what it is. So OK, I'll go ahead and and pay that fee so that I can do this. Now what were the things that you said you needed from me?", "am I going to be able to file a dispute for the charges charges that the gym has put on my account after I asked for them to cancel my membership?", "OK so, this . You're you're gonna go ahead and take care of that. So this protection plan do I do I get charged for that? Like is that something I pay for or is that am I. How does that work, like do I need to upgrade it? Because I I really don't want things like this happening where I get charged for things that I shouldn't."]}

I'm do you have one on the east side of town?", "OK. But how soon can I have them to pull them out?", "Unless you can find me a smaller apartment, than no.", "Yeah, if we can do it right now, that would be great.", "Yep. Sounds great. What are you going to need from me?", "OK, you can tell me where it's at in the hospital then.", "Yeah what's that called and I'll have him do it for me.", "yes, I've been thinking about doing that. is it secure?", "Oh. How about what street I grew up on? Would that work?", "Oh, wow. Actually, I can just stop there after work then.", "yeah if you could give me that again that would be great.", "Oh yeah. I'm interested in doing that. How does that work?", "I think we might be. Is it better if we come to the branch?", "No that's good but can you find me a couple in Fairlawn too?", "Yeah. So, I need to find a location that's close to my home.", "OK so you got two locations close by? Alright I'll take those.", "OK. That one is a little bit further can you give me one more?", "Oh, wow. Well, maybe we can have. Get them to have a play date.", "Yeah, if you can find one close to my house, that'd be perfect.", "Yeah, sure. Would you send it to my home or how is the process?", "OK. Well, what about the Indiana one. Is that inside or outside?", "Yeah. That'd be fine. I'd be OK with that. How much is in there?", "Yeah. You can just tell me which is the one that is closer to me.", "I'd like a full service. that means it has a drive-through, correct?", "I I can do that in the drive-thru right? I I I don't wanna go inside.", "Oh OK. That would be great. If you get them can you throw them in jail?", "you can find whoever did this and lock them up. Can you do that for me?", "Yeah, it's a pain. I'd prefer to stay with you guys but what can you do?", "Unless you can find me a new husband then no. Thank you. Have a nice day.", "Yeah, sure. Just give me all that information and I write everything down.", "I think that's probably like four or five blocks away. Got anything closer?", "Do you need a second one? Cuz I have a second one. It's just that's the one.", "Is there anyway I can change that and get it sent to my grandmother's house?", "Sure, thank you so much. I was gonna ask, what is involved in setting it up.", "Oh, really. Maybe I should have come in. But we can do it on the phone right.", "well, that'd be perfect. All right. Yeah. can you go ahead and send that to me?", "OK, that's actually a lot closer. can you tell me, does it have a drive through?", "Great. is there. Is there another close by one? This way I can maybe have a choice.", "You know I don't really feel comfortable giving that out. Is that gonna be required?", "yeah so I guess if you can get me, you know, a direction to go to get started with that?", "Yeah, I. I want to come in. I would like to come in and get the local branch to help me out.", "Yeah, you know what? Just give me the number and give me the address, in case I decide to go.", "OK. Yeah it's it's it's Intellibank. all right. So, or like where do I need to turn down here?", "Would it have been better if I went just directly there or is it easier just to call you guys?", "Yeah sure. You can just give me the the the place where I can check that and that's everything.", "Oh I I thought you were gonna answer the question for a second All right. How about my first pet?", "OK I'll do it but is my husband gonna be attached to it cuz I don't want him to have access to it.", "I know that! That's that's really really close. Thank you! Do you have one by my work by any chance?", "OK now that one is a little bit too far. Could you give me another one, or see if you could find one.", "I'm not drawing very much interest. And I really don't use it. So yeah, I'd like to just close it I guess.", "Yeah, can you go ahead and send me that? And the first chance I get I'll go ahead and try to sign up for it.", "Yeah, what time is it? Oh, it's about three. yeah I I think I can get over there if it's if it's still open.", "Oh OK. Do you know what the parking is like down there? and my stimulator have a drive through option in as well.", "OK, I know where that is. That's very close. I think that'll work. Is there a, what would the next closest one be?", "Oh that's great. I think it is actually a little ways away. I think I probably will drive. and so, tell me the address.", "Well give me the address anyways. Fifteen minutes I guess is not so bad. Maybe it might someplace I can go once a week or so.", "actually, anything around two p.m. today would be great, if anybody have anything available. Does anyone have anything free then?", "And I was wondering do I need to drive to the branch? But I don't really want to go inside and wear a mask. can I do that online or on", "Well, you know what, I just need the closest one to my house, so can you just give me the hours for the closest one to my home please?", "Oh, that's wonderful. I would just like to have the closest address to my home. I just need to know what times they are they operating.", "actually, can you just tell me the closest branch, then? I'll just go there and do everything because I'm kind of in a hurry right now.", "Oh that's awesome. OK I think I'm gonna check into that. where do I go to to learn to to fill out the forms and stuff? Do I come into the branch?", "Like I meant more on the north side of Chicago. Like, if you can help me find find a location more on the north side of Chicago. I'm headed that way.", "can you give me one second? I got to Google the ZIP we're in. How how fast you think you could if, I'm in Chicago. How fast do you think I might get it?", "Yeah. Makes sense. did we already open the new one or are we going to close the old one and then open? Because I I thought I had to have a new one to receive it. That's first.", "OK can you confirm that their still open for me though? So that I know that nothings changed though. I just don't want to drive all the way over there and then find out there not open either.", "OK, well could you maybe give me one or two locations and then I can always decide from there, because like I said I don't have a vehicle and I'll either have to walk or take a bus to get there.", "I can open it with a hundred and fifty and just be able to access it when I need and of course right before you know, right before Christmas I'll probably use most of it. Do I need to keep some in at all times?", "You know I don't think so you know Let me see here. Let me look at me list. Oh Is there parking near the branch or is that something because I know with Britain you have to park on the streets. Am I going to have to pay to park to go in there?"]}

I might been wanting want to do a balance transfer here in the near future. but I I won't do that today. Do you happen to know what if there are any fees involved in doing balance transfer like wire transfer?", "OK, so that really wouldn't be one to have for like a one time thing. I was just looking for something that I could put like a little extra money on and put it aside for this wedding. Do you have any other type of card that that might?", "Oh my gosh. So that's my daughters dance and I totally forgot that that payment would process on the first. OK. I I have the cash for that can I go deposit that so I can make it right and then you guys draft the payment again or something?", "Oh no no thanks right now. I I just don't have the time. I need to head to the store before they close and get what I need. but I might swing by later when I'm free. is there any way that I could also come into the bank and set it up if I need to?", "No. I mean. So actually I really need to get this deposited soon. I I was wondering like can I make the deposit through the ATM or whatever? I I can call back later to reset everything online.

I have all of his information for his bank and everything. I just didn't know if I could do it through you guys or if I had to go to like Western Union or something.", "Oh OK. That actually makes sense. so I'll definitely do that. Moving forward I'll. I'll take a look and try to get the app and see if I can keep an eye on my balances but while I do have you on the phone, could I ask for another favor and for you to check my savings account", "well, do you think that maybe you could help find me an ATM over near where he lives. I'll just ride over there and take out the cash and give it to him instead of trying to transfer it to his account. and I'll probably end up finding that paper when I come back from doing all that.", "No. That's OK. it should hit in, in a couple of days. But since I do have you on the phone. Could you tell me my, my second savings account balance in there? I don't think it's much. But I think, yeah, I'm not too sure how much I have in there. Can you just remind me really quick what's the savings account?", "Well, the holidays are coming up and I was thinking to maybe get a separate account going for some gift buying. I've grandchildren now and I could use some you know, some extra little money squirreled away to get them some nice gifts. So do you have anything along those lines that I holiday accounts or whatnot?", "Awesome. I think that should be good for when I go to the store. do have another question to ask you. not sure I can't remember exactly but is there any money back or something like that on the card? that I'm gonna be using? And in case there is do you know like how much I get back and when the money gets I guess put into my account?", "They'll they'll be frequent transfers hopefully I can find you guys have a sister company or a sister bank over there that would make this easy but I've worked over there and I need to make I need my company's in the US and I'm gonna need to get money while I'm overseas so I need to find the transfer. Some way to make get me funds in the Italy's.", "Actually, it wasn't the best, and it's part of the reason I'm calling. I planned a nice surprise dinner out for my husband and myself, my treat.

I should have had enough to cover our dinner.", "Doing good. I I I have a few things to go over with my account and I guess the number one issue. It's not even an issue. number one thing I wanna do is do a wire transfer. My my parents are going away on vacation. Then it this is like a present from me to them for all they've done for me. So I'm I'm gonna I wanna send them some money to pay for their trip.", "Oh, OK. well I do have a question. I appreciate those and yes they are close to me, but is there anyway you either have something closer?

I'm going out of town, and I was wondering if I can give you like the city I'm going to that way my credit card doesn't get frozen. I'm gonna be travelling to Michigan. So if you could just put that some place if you can, that way when you sees things going in Michigan, I won't get that.", "Oh OK.

I don't know if you ever worked, you know this type of construction but they work hard and they need to get paid on time and so, so what I'm gonna do since the business account is running short, is I wanna loan myself some money, or am loan the business some money.

I know some local branches or different branches have different stipulations as far as ATMs can you please provide that for me?", "Yeah I I need I need ATM I need I want to know what kind of ATM cuz there are so many different ones and I have a lotta cash at hand with my job sometimes so I just had to had to question, where is the closest one from butter tree cup?", "OK, thank you and So I found the multiples. Oh I do apologize it's been a long day, is it possible you could tell me the daily withdrawal limit? and if I'm able to deposit cash into the ATM up to like what amount or do I have to actually go to a branch to do it?", "And also, you know that that ATM at that Walmart will be great. but I have one more question about that. Does that Walmart have the ITM to where they have the integrated teller. You push that button and you can talk to a real person. You know if you have an issue?", "let, let, let alone not only the bank, an ATM, to get some money out. And I don't wanna use any other ATMs, because there's fees and, I mean, it's not worth it. On top of it I'm spending gas. So I don't know. I'm just thinking what to do if, if I should just I think I'm gonna close this account.", "Now now another thing I was wondering like I I saw your signs on some of the ATMs but I was wondering like what what ATMs have different services I I saw two of them just within three miles of the house. The one do they have the ITM? what do they call it? Inter Interactive, the interactive teller? Where if I push a button I could talk to somebody.", "I do have your online banking, but since I moved I don't have my internet set up yet at the house. So soon as I do I'll be able to access that again. And it shouldn't be a problem. Now now at your at your ATMs, do you have the the where you can put cash in. Can you deposit cash through the machine like some some of them used to do when I lived in Saint Saint Albans?", "no. That's that's all that's good. I'm gonna wait for the rain to to stop. Actually hold on. Do you think it would be a good idea, before I go to the ATM cause I know how you know all these people you know they look at you watch you push buttons and then they take your money out. I should probably know how much money I have in my account before I got to the ATM you think that's a good idea?"]}

And one of them is at Walmart for two hundred thirty-five dollars and there's one at Target for three hundred and fifty dollars. Can I dispute those charges?", "I think I might have said it wrong. So what I mean is like you know those Visa cards that I've gotten for like the holiday's and stuff. Their Visa cards and you can put money on them and like you can use them everywhere. I'll there might be a fee or something to put the money on them.", "Well, I do have a couple of things. I want to know is there any other way that I can report if heaven forbid this were to happen again any other way I can report a stolen card rather than waiting you know I found. I figured it out last night. I had to wait till the bank open this morning.", "no actually I have not. I don't have access online. Can you block the card? I'm not sure. I even have the card with me right now. I I pretty sure. It's somewhere. I don't use it that often that's why I know it's not my transaction. How can I do this online on my own without having to call?", "Yes. I was actually wondering about the you know I travel a lot and I have my gold card with me but I don't know why it doesn't really work. The gold card. Is it. Is there any other card that I'm maybe. I'm. I don't know. I. I'm, I'm using my gold card for my traveling, is. Is that all right?", "Oh, wow. Well that's good to know. I want to transfer a thousand dollar to each account. And if we can place on hold on my daughter's account, she lost her debit card last night partying. I don~. She can't remember what she did with it. It's kind of embarrassing but that happens to her quite often.", "Yeah. It it wasn't an issue until recently. Oh you know what I I just remembered, never mind, it's not the card actually. The restaurant where I go for lunch everyday has a faulty chip reader. That's right, they told me that. I was thinking it was the card, sorry, but it's not. I'd like to keep the card I have.", "yes. So I am looking here. I have a double charge on my credit card. It's for fourteen ninety-nine on on June twentieth from a company called Roebucks. I am fine with one charge but they charged me twice for the same exact thing. So I'm gonna need that to be disputed and like delete it. I don't wanna pay it twice.", "yes yes I noticed that the last time when I checked my account there was a transaction that was coming and I was wondering if it go through and it was a transaction that I approved. It was for Amazon. I bought something on Amazon and I think it was twenty-four dollars. Can you please check to see if it was approved?", "no, but I do need to dispute a charge on my checking account. the, you know, the same account number that you just deposited the money into. there was a charge on September seventeenth. for twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents. from a company that I didn't recognize. it just says T Y B L. so I I I did wanna dispute that charge.", "OK I I can't find my account number. I, I swear I just had it I'm so irritated. I have been a customer with you guys for a long time I'm you know I don't know why we always have to go through all this information. Is there anything else that we could you know look up to potentially look at my, my account balance? I really need it.", "Yes, ma'am. That's correct, and the charge that I did not make. It was made the following day it seems. for almost two thousand dollars with Microsoft. Well, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents And definitely did not make that, although I really could use a new computer. But it's not a good time", "Yes. Not really like a transaction but I'm seeing charges going out of my phone. so so I don't know cuz I've not done any transaction yet. But . I don't know, this charge is going out of my phone. I really don't know what the charges are for because you have not given me my my. I've not got my card yet, so what are these charges for?", "Oh wow, oh my God. I really wanted to to deposit a check online through my phone I live out in the desert area so it's like hard for me to get to the bank. The closest bank is like literally far out. but anyway, I'm gonna give you my ZIP code. Hopefully you find something. the ZIP code is one zero sixteen one nine zero sixteen, sorry about that.", "so I have received so. First of all, I don't shop really online and I don't know where this charge is coming from. So, I have never bought anything from them. I call them they said that they can't find me in the system, but they have not re-returned my money. from from my credit card. So I want you guys to call them and get my money back, please.", "I would like to go ahead. Can we can we lock that? Can we go ahead and just send me a new card because I'm thinking somehow. I mean I've got I've got the card on my person, but I'm unable to use my I couldn't use my card or credentials to get into to my app, and I had that stuff saved so I'm thinking that somehow someone got my password or something.", "Well that's fine. I just. I want the card shut off. I don't want it. I don't want people using it to buy money buy stuff and. And I don't want to lose all my money. And I I just paid it down. I need it done now. I'm trying to go on vacation and. This is not something that I can handle right now. What can you. Can you stop it from getting used from where you are?", "Yes and then I actually in addition to that had a charge that I saw on there when I opened my last bank statement and I I didn't recognize the charge. So I actually wanted to dispute that charge but here I am not being able to find my account information. am I able to do these stuff online? Do you know? Once I find it. So I don't have to callback and wait on hold.", "Adam and Eves! I have never even been to that kind of store. What. That OK. I'm the only one with this card and I did not go to that store and I know my husband does not have my card and he did not go to that store so I know that store is not. Nope nope. No. That is not my purchase I. No, we're recording right now. How do I get rid of this? I want my money back now.", "Right, exactly. I tried to go online on you know, on my. On the on the bank account online And expand it to see if I could find any information. I didn't see a telephone number and I don't recognize the company. I did try to Google it but I still didn't recognize that company at all so I. I definitely need you know, need to have that removed cuz that wasn't something I charged.", "Yeah I don't. I. I just know what I thought it was cuz it was. It was odd cuz we made a purchase but. But the dollar amount did not match up. We made a purchase for two thousand. Like around two thousand dollars but the purchase it came back for like around thirty-five hundred dollars and I was like OK, did did we miss miss something that was charged more than. Than. Than what we thought?", "It's one hundred and fifty-three dollars and eleven cents. it looks like it's like a some sort of tech company. when I try to look it up online I couldn't find a telephone number for the company to contact them It didn't look like it was based out of the US. So I'm not sure but I just wanted to call you guys and dispute it coz I know that I haven't used any services from any type of company like this.", "So I really want to dispute a charge that is on my card. I called earlier to see monies had been credited back to my account for a purchase that I made and returned, but it hasn't been credited. and it was purchase that I made on eBay and I I sent the item back to the seller, but they have not returned my funds and I know that they have received it because I got return. Like a return postage on it so that I know that they got the item back already.", "No, I definitely did not. I do not live in California. I've not visited California, and I called this place to see if perhaps they were like an online merchant, like you know maybe I'd bought something and forgot. but they don't sell anything online. I have wracked my brain, I've asked my husband. I have tried and tried to figure out where this charge could have come from but the only thing I can figure out is that someone's stolen my account information.", "sure. It's for ninety-seven dollars and fifteen cents. it looks like, based on what I'm seeing online, it was charged to my account on September second and the the company name looks like it says Tech dash N O. but I don't I don't recognize the name and I've never seen this company or I definitely didn't charge anything for this amount. I don't know. Does it say on your end what like any any more information about the company, maybe where it's from or anything or a telephone number maybe?", "Well, I was doing all right until I got my credit card statement in the mail and I was looking and on my transactions I I'm seeing a transaction on the twenty-ninth of September from Apple for the amount of two thousand four hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents and I did not make that. So I've looked around for my credit card. I can't find it anywhere. I don't I guess maybe the last time I used it, I might have left it on the counter or dropped it somewhere. I don't know what happened.", "well I was calling because I was looking on my account earlier today and I've and maybe I'm just like overthinking it but I seen a transaction that I I didn't recognize and you know I was I was out of town last week so I think like maybe it's possible that like I used it my card or something and I couldn't remember. I don't know but I just feel like it's not something that I had you know something that I had done so, I don't know, I was just hoping that maybe you could give me some insight as to like what this transaction was.", "Yeah so you so you see every every morning me and my friends would meet for breakfast before we go to work and this morning we went to go and when I went to pay for my breakfast I pulled my wallet out and my card was missing. And I don't know where it is, what happened. The last time I used it was at yesterday's breakfast then I don't know if I didn't get the card back. I asked. We usually go to the same place and I asked them while we were there and my card was not recovered there or found or anything so I'm not sure what the next step to do here or the process. Do I close my account? Should I I I think like in my head already which I'm thinking I wanna transfer some of my money out of my account to make sure I'm safe so. can you like instruct me what to do next?"]}

They're just a scan card so I think the chip cards are a lot more security.", "OK. That's good because I did lose the card and I haven't been able to find it. So, that will make is so no one can use the card. Is that correct or do I need to go through a whole new process with that?", "OK. Well, that's fine.
