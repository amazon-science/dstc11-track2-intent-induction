I am I'm a little frustrated actually because I have been trying to access my account information online and the site is down again. and it seems like it's just it. It's been happening, you know, quite often lately. I was trying to look at my account balance online and had zero luck getting in. So, I I need your assistance actually it. to transfer money from my savings to my checking. that was also something I was going to do online, but, you know, since the site was down I've. I'm not able to do that either so.", "OK, Mike. I have been trying to send my friend some money for days now. It just won't go through. Can you help?", "Please, I made a transfer to my sister. She's yet to receive the credit.", "You know before I even realized there was this transaction that happened, in my head I already thought to myself why don't I transfer you know just you know maybe for a couple weeks like ten thousand dollars from my checking into my saving. This way I know they can't access that money.", "OK, so I have been trying to use the USSD for some days now and has not been connecting. I have a lot of transactions to do and nothing is working fine. What exactly is the problem with this bank? We really want to do transfer. We want to make a transfer. I can't check my account balance and I want to check account balance. So what exactly are you guys doing? Everything is wack. I'm not sorry to say that, so why can't I make transfer? Why can't I check my account balance? Why can't I recharge my phone? Why can't I make subscriptions when I need to make subscriptions? And you keep deducting money unnecessary. What exactly is the problem?", "Also I wanna to report a stolen card and I wanted to transfer money from the the account that the card was attached to to another account.", "That account is two two eight seven. I don't use that one often. If we can take the money from that transfer it to two two seven seven and then I wanna close that account. will I receive some type of documentation confirming that the account is closed after this this call?", "Yes, I do have a question. is there. Can I sign into my account instead of making a call to report a card or make a transfer?", "yes sir, let me get it. It's just been annoying. I've been trying to get this transfer and this y'all's y'all's site is not working.", "So I don't really know what to do about that. I'm just worried about my money getting used. so I want to get the money out of my credit card and put it in another bank so that if it is lost and someone tries to use it there is no credit available to use. Does that make sense?", "Yes hi good evening, my name is Miss Alison Ashworth and I was trying to get information on the intel transfer.", "Yes. I believe that it has been hacked. I keep getting random withdrawals. I would like to take the money from that account and put it in a different account, please."]}
