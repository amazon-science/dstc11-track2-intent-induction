I need to get the balance of my account. you know what? Never mind, I don't need that. I'm at a hotel downtown and I don't want them to use my debit card. because they might lock it up. Can you help me with some nearby ATM machine please?", "while you're looking at that, are these ATMs drive ups or do I have to get out of my car?", "Yeah I'm over at the west gate plaza.

Hey, you got an answer to that thing I asked you earlier about where the ATM was located?", "OK but the ATMs available twenty-four hours sir?", "Oh OK so how does that walk-up work? Like what do you mean a walk-up ATM? I'm kind of confused. Can you explain that?", "OK. Does it tell you those times in your system. Can you tell me if one of those ATMs has certain times?", "OK. OK, now let's just say that I was going to visit your branch after hours. Is there a way I can access your ATM machine on the is your ATM machine going to be accessible?", "no, it. Wait, is there a local branch nearby? Just in case I need to withdraw money over the limit.", "No, I'm good. In fact, I think that I'll check out the the first one you told me about. About near the coffee shop. do you do you know if they accept cash deposits at that ATM?", "OK. All right. Well, that's good to know. And I have a question. In case I don't remember what you've said, or if I'm gonna meet somebody at a location that's not by my house, How can I find a list of your ATMs? There has to be a list somewhere of locations.", "No, I think that's OK. I would like to know what's the daily withdraw limit and does the ATM accept cash deposits?", "I'm sorry. I got distracted by something on my computer. I meant to ask you, do you guys charge a fee to withdraw funds from the ATM?", "OK. What if I use a different ATM? What are your fees?", "Is that on every ATM or just that one?", "Yes, I need to find an ATM near where I am.", "yeah. And and when I get to the ATM , how much can I use how much can I take out for the what is it Money or money removal? Is that.", "yes. I need to find an ATM close to where I am.", "Oh oh well that's that's good. Now now what if it's a different bank's ATM machine?", "I guess so.

Is there a limit on how much cash you can deposit at the ATM?", "My name is Julie and I was wondering if I could do some transaction changes. But first I wanted to ask, do you have any ATMs in the bank?", "Yeah that'd be fine. Does it. Does it charge or anything to make an ATM withdrawal?", "OK. OK, then. Yeah, I got a couple more question about this ATM ATM machine? Now, how many transfer am I having to make?", "Do we have any near ATMs or?", "no I can't think of anything . Let's see tell me again what if there's a additional ATMs in addition to the one that you gave me? Cuz that's just one what if they're out of money?", "OK and it looks like it's from a different bank. is there a nearby ATM? I can give you the address of the place.", "Great for future reference can I access a list of the ATM locations from website? Going on vacation soon and it would really be helpful.", "No. I need to find the nearest ATM and dispute a transaction.", "yes, actually. So I'm out of town. and I I wanted to make sure I could still use the ATM and it wouldn't flag me for something because I'm out of town.", "OK, this might be a silly question, but you know how when you get money out of the ATM , it just comes like in, you, twenties or something, you don't get fives and ones. If I put it back, do I only. Can I only put it back in denominations of twenties and hundreds?", "Yes. I need to find an ATM location.", "That's right. I'm looking for a nearby ATM and also I want to know if bank is gonna be closed for Memorial Day.", "Great. OK, so you've giving me the two closest ATMs which is great and we're opening the new savings account, I assume you'll be sending me information on that.", "is any other ATMs around that area? that the only one?", "Oh OK.

I was calling to find a ATM. Near me.", "no. That's that's all that's good. I'm gonna wait for the rain to to stop. Actually hold on. Do you think it would be a good idea, before I go to the ATM cause I know how you know all these people you know they look at you watch you push buttons and then they take your money out. I should probably know how much money I have in my account before I got to the ATM you think that's a good idea?", "yes. I'm. I was shopping for a gift for a birthday gift for my wife. I need to find an ATM machine nearby, for a withdrawal. I also to make a transfer from from my savings to checking account please.", "About that that I had to call an IT guy and get a certain number verification So, if that hadn't changed, I'll that'd be great. Now, do you have does that ATM have the cash deposits where I can deposit cash anytime I want?", "OK and then I'll be able to do all my transactions there. The all right, I think I think that'll. That should do it. I I feel bad that we're no longer in the hunt for the national league baseball. Did you did you happen to see the game last night?", "This is Jennifer Johnston. I wanted to see if my direct deposit came through today. Actually I need help finding an ATM. I've been driving around everywhere looking for one.

ATM thing?", "yes, ma'am. where can I find the nearest ATM? And could you also tell me if that ATM location, if there's also a banking institution with Intelligence Bank?", "How about CVS? Can you use them?", "I just wanted to ask you, the ATM location and and everything, that I can find on on your website, on Intellibank dot com, right?", "Well I've got the mobile app. And I'll probably just go ahead and use that because I think I could get directions straight from it. Yeah, I'm new to this new place, anyways. So what about fees? What do they do with those cause I know you when I lived in Alabama we had locations you everywhere and I didn't have to worry about those new fees because I was always using you Intellibank's ATMs but so what what's like the fees like if I if I don't use an Intellibank?", "OK. Yes sir well that'd be just great Intellibank. Go right in there cause I don't wanna do ATM. I I mean I don't know when does it post up with the ATM? Maybe it post up today and and maybe not. But, what I wanna do is make sure that it gets I get this deposit posted today. Because like I said I may have over spent down at the battlefield.", "Hello, I'm calling to locate an Intellibank near me and find a ATM.", "no. I don't think so. I think that's really good.

I can make that nearest one but it sounds like I'll be there after close. Is there at least a deposit slip or deposit you know drop box that I can make my deposit in there since it's after hours?", "Yeah, so I need to change the account number thing that I put in whenever I go to the ATM.", "Hi. I just had a quick question regarding ATMs. I just wanted to know honestly can I use an ATM to take money out from my account or does it have to be a Intellibank ATM?", "So know if I it is is is totally good for for me. But another big question is can I make a deposit. Because I noticed a few times I've gone, and I don't know if it was like ATMs I went to that were not Intellibank ATMs that I couldn't make a deposit, or will I be able to make a deposit? I need to make a. Make a deposit and a withdrawal at the same time today.", "Do you happen to like have a good cab service you'd recommend for someone around here?", "Ooh yeah guess I'd better guess I'd better look for one that's with Intellibank. do your ATM machines take cash deposits?", "Yes, I I need a Intellibank ATM because those other ones they could charge like five dollars. For a transaction and I tried. I took out twenty dollars once and I got charged five dollars for the transaction and that's like twenty-five percent. That's kinda. That's .", "OK and is it possible for me to use a ATM machine that's not with Intellibank?"]}
