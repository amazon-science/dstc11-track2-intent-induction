So my wife sent me out to the house to go get groceries. She gave me four hundred dollars and while I was on my way to the grocery store I I listen to my podcast and it gave me this really hot tip this undeniably good tip.

One thing leads to another and I'm out four hundred dollars so I really need cash right now to go get groceries before my wife kills me.", "Cuz my my car's getting old. That's why I'm down at the store all the time getting auto parts coz it's just getting to be a a train wreck and I need to get a new vehicle, so. and I have I'm pretty sure I have good credit and I'm really considering getting an auto loan through you guys. You guys have been real good to me over the years. And you know thanks a lot. Now what just bring all my information in? Like I give you just all my my credit card and my credit check and all that stuff? Or your guys do that?", "It is really something to see. I was able to stand right there where they had the trenches back in the old days and right where they had the canons set up and they still had some of the old canons there. And, you could look out right across to where the canons would be shooting and blowing things up. And I bought this mortar shell. It was a spent mortar shell that somebody had collected from there and several bullet fragments from the mini balls and a it was really really really fine fine day. And, I I think I may of spent more than I intended in. So what I'm thinking I oughta do is to make a deposit on my way home so I can get some more money in the bank just in case I I need it Like I say, I think I may have over spent some.", "OK well like I said, I'm a carpenter. And so I've got I've got my personal account and then I got my business account and usually I make my business expenses all out of the business account. My personal expenses I keep separate for tax purposes and and what have you, but I'm involved in this real big job that I haven't got paid on yet. But I'm gonna be paid on it real soon. And so I guess what I am trying to say is I need to kind of loan myself or loan the business some money temporarily cuz I got I got payroll coming up and I got some real good workers for me. I don't know if you ever worked, you know this type of construction but they work hard and they need to get paid on time and so, so what I'm gonna do since the business account is running short, is I wanna loan myself some money, or am loan the business some money. And so, that's that's why I'm saying this I try need to try to get twenty-five hundred dollars out of my personal account and into my business account is basically what I I'm kind of a personal loan is what I'm saying, or a business loan from from my personal account."]}

How much does that cost?", "Yeah, but are you gonna give me all that money back on the fees?", "Zero zero zero, nine five one three two. Will there be a charge?", "Well, what about the maintenance fees? I still have to pay those?", "All right. Good. If they do take anything out will I be reimbursed?", "OK. Thank you. Also can I have the due date on my credit card bill?", "Yes, what are the rates on that card. You know, the interest rates.", "Well, before we start will there be a charge? Or how does that work?", "All right. That sounds great. Is is there a fee associated with this?", "Yes, you said that the second one has to have how much in it monthly?", "that's not very much and is there a fee associated with that account?", "Is there a minimum that I need to transfer for no in order to be fees?", "no. Well, there's no fees if it's if I'm using one of our ATMs, right?", "It does. really quick before we process that are there any transfer fees?", "Do I include that in the amount that I tell you when I say want to wire it?", "Yes but will there be any fees of transactions when I do anything like that?", "that will be great. And do you guys have any fees for international charges?", "OK. And I asked you a question, is there a fee for any of these transactions?", "so I was hoping you could tell me what my interest rate is on my credit card.", "Well let's see. How much did she charge? Oh that was about sixty-eight dollars.", "I don't think so. Does it show that it's a membership fee or a subscription fee?", "Perfect. OK that's great. And can you go ahead and check the savings for me too?", "ma'am, but before you do that, will there be a charge doing a internal transfer?", "And there's no minimum of what I'm going to be putting into this account, correct?", "I really can't think of anything. Oh is there any fees associated with doing this?", "Yes. And also by the way I also wanna get my interest rate for my savings. Account.", "Yes I had a concern, by chance is there a monthly fee and if so, how can I avoid it?", "Oh, absolutely, and just to check it and see would there be any charge for doing this?", "Sure, no problem. I really hope I could get the rate locked for the next twelve months.", "Well if I do that are there gonna be an any fees, do you have a fee for online banking?", "Oh well I'm only going to send her a hundred dollars. So what will that fee be for for me?", "OK. I believe I take the ones that closest to me. is there a fee for that? Transaction fee?", "Oh, boy. Thank you. I'm really excited about this. I also want to know about checking fees.", "Yes. I was just curious as to why I'm being charged a five-dollar fee on a savings account?", "Hi I got a mail this today and It say something about you guys raising the fees, my monthly fee.", "Thank you for letting me know that, because I was going to ask was there extra fees or for that.", "first of all, how much will will I be charged for such an amount? As in, what what are the rates?", "Do you know by any chance you know, just from top of your head, like what are the rates for the car", "That is absurd. Why should I have to pay a fee? No. You need to see if you can waive that. I'm not.", "OK. And I'm still on that current monthly scheduled transfer fee of that twenty-five dollars, right?", "OK. That sounds great. So I'm definitely not going to be charged just from just checking to savings.", "That's awfully steep. Is there a, a cheaper way of doing this? That's faster, or, just some other way?", "Well, that's not very much and I believe I'm being charged a fee each month just to have that account.", "Oh, can I ask you something? will I have to pay for this and and how long will it take to dispute this?", "Oh, those are such bad rates for both of those option. I will like to continue with opening a new account.", "was thinking about opening a savings account and I was wanting to know the interest rate rate that was paid.", "Oh sorry. I forgot I had another question. Will I get charged for asking a customer service agent to help me?", "no, but what is it a five dollar monthly fee or a ten dollar monthly fee if my account went below a thousand?", "OK and the the one that's closest to me walking distance is there any fees transaction fees that I have to do?", "OK. What kind of interest rate am I getting on that account and is there a a monthly fee associated with that?", "I received a notice about a rate increase but I was told by another agent this wouldn't happen until next year.", "OK. I can I can do that. I I've got a savings account with you. is there any way you can waive that fee for me?", "OK, and no one's putting a hold on it right? Like am I gonna get taxed or like investigated for that much money?", "OK, that's fine. Cuz if this is a subscription I wanna make sure that I'm not charged again like this next month.", "I was wondering if you could tell me whether I will have any additional fees. Will I owe anything more to you guys?", "OK, will that charge? Will y'all charge me for that or is that free of charge cuz I'm a customer? How does that work?", "Oh, oh! And and can you also like find out what's the limit on there? Cuz I have to pay like, you know, two months worth.", "yes that's acceptable. Maybe transfer a little bit more then to compensate for that fee. How much did you say it was again?", "Actually, since I have you on the phone, can you tell me about the mortgages you guys have? What's the current rate? Or, you know.", "OK. So in order to not pay the four dollar and ninety-nine cent fee would I have to have. Would that fee deposits and checks or or.", "OK and by the way I got something in the mail about a rate interest increase. And I was told it was fixed so is can you explain that?", "I don't. Six months of free? No, I don't need No. It's not in the question. I just need the fee waived. I've been a customer long enough.", "This one seems to be good. I was just does does this have any fees? Like per dollar amount is there a certain amount that they're gonna ask for?", "But it is what it is. So OK, I'll go ahead and and pay that fee so that I can do this. Now what were the things that you said you needed from me?", "yes. I got a noticed in the mail for my saving account that I just set up and it looks like I'm being charged a fee each month. kinda looks like I I don't know why but", "I can't. Well, yeah you can you can give me some info on your savings account. I'm looking for the interest rate, and is there a fee associated with having a savings account?", "OK. So is that guaranteed? That like it's it's going to get taken care of? Like it's not like a well maybe maybe it will, maybe it won't type thing? Like I'll pay it once, but I won't pay it twice.", "The savings account, it the fees. It look like you guys are raising the fee next month I don't know what is going on. why are you guys raising the fee? And how did this happen? Nobody notify me about this.", "yes. I just received my Intel savings account statement and I'm questioning the fee that's being charged each month. It looks like I'm being charged a five dollar fee and I just want to know what that's about.", "good question. So we just moved recently so do you know they were charging. They were charging. Well, I already know our rent was expensive. Do you know they were gonna raise our rent two hundred dollars a month?", "I'm trying to think. I might been wanting want to do a balance transfer here in the near future. but I I won't do that today. Do you happen to know what if there are any fees involved in doing balance transfer like wire transfer?", "I just wanted to make sure, the last savings account at another bank was horrible. I never really made anything off the interest and it charged me more than more fees than anything. So, I wanna make sure I'm getting a good savings account this time.", "so I've what I'm calling about basically is that I got a letter in the mail that said the rates are going to change and I wanted to see if I personally was going to be affected by this or is you know is it for everybody or what's the rate change going to be.", "actually, yes. I had called a few weeks ago and I spoke with someone about possibly getting an auto loan for a new car and I was wondering if you could tell me if the interest rates were any better right now that those auto loans now that we're kind of in a different part of of the month?", "Yeah, yeah. As long as there's no fee. I mean I know thank God you all didn't charge me a, a overdraft fee. And I was, I was really calling and fretting over that because I, I, I know is was, that accounts been negative for a while. I was trying to figure out was I was I blessed to not get charged or something?", "OK so, this . You're you're gonna go ahead and take care of that. So this protection plan do I do I get charged for that? Like is that something I pay for or is that am I. How does that work, like do I need to upgrade it? Because I I really don't want things like this happening where I get charged for things that I shouldn't.", "Well I've got the mobile app. And I'll probably just go ahead and use that because I think I could get directions straight from it. Yeah, I'm new to this new place, anyways. So what about fees? What do they do with those cause I know you when I lived in Alabama we had locations you everywhere and I didn't have to worry about those new fees because I was always using you Intellibank's ATMs but so what what's like the fees like if I if I don't use an Intellibank?"]}

I am looking at my statement, I just received it in the mail and I see a charge on here that I don't recognize. the date of the charge Oh, I'm sorry. You probably need some information to pull up my account first. I'll let you go through all all of that.", "Hi Rose. My name is Kim. I need some help please with a transaction that I don't recognize. I am looking at my statement and I I'm not recognizing the this charge or this company. so I need some help with that and then I also want to transfer some money from my my checking to my savings account.", "yes. So I am looking here. I have a double charge on my credit card. It's for fourteen ninety-nine on on June twentieth from a company called Roebucks. I am fine with one charge but they charged me twice for the same exact thing. So I'm gonna need that to be disputed and like delete it. I don't wanna pay it twice.", "That's hilarious. Well, Rose. I called today about I need a couple of things actually. I need to close my savings account that I have with you all. and I also had a charge show up on my checking account that I need to check check check with you guys cuz I don't recognize that and I would like to dispute the charge.", "yes yes I noticed that the last time when I checked my account there was a transaction that was coming and I was wondering if it go through and it was a transaction that I approved. It was for Amazon. I bought something on Amazon and I think it was twenty-four dollars. Can you please check to see if it was approved?", "no, but I do need to dispute a charge on my checking account. the, you know, the same account number that you just deposited the money into. there was a charge on September seventeenth. for twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents. from a company that I didn't recognize. it just says T Y B L. so I I I did wanna dispute that charge.", "Yes, ma'am. That's correct, and the charge that I did not make. It was made the following day it seems. for almost two thousand dollars with Microsoft. Well, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents And definitely did not make that, although I really could use a new computer. But it's not a good time", "Yes. Not really like a transaction but I'm seeing charges going out of my phone. so so I don't know cuz I've not done any transaction yet. But . I don't know, this charge is going out of my phone. I really don't know what the charges are for because you have not given me my my. I've not got my card yet, so what are these charges for?", "OK so on June twentieth I have on June twentieth I was charged twice is is really what happened. I was charged fourteen ninety-nine twice by a company called Robux. I did want one of the charges. I did authorize one of the charges but that company has charged me twice for the same exact thing. So I need to get that disputed and deleted.", "so I have received so. First of all, I don't shop really online and I don't know where this charge is coming from. So, I have never bought anything from them. I call them they said that they can't find me in the system, but they have not re-returned my money. from from my credit card. So I want you guys to call them and get my money back, please.", "Actually, it wasn't the best, and it's part of the reason I'm calling. I planned a nice surprise dinner out for my husband and myself, my treat. But when I went to pay, my debit card was declined. So, he ended up paying for his own, surprise. It was very embarrassing. I need to check my last five transactions. I should have had enough to cover our dinner.", "I'm doing pretty good. I have a question for you. I was looking at my statement that I just received in the mail for the charges for last month and I see something on here that I don't recognize. that I don't recognize the amount or the the company that's charging me, so I'd like to actually dispute that transaction. I was wondering if you could help me with that.", "Yes and then I actually in addition to that had a charge that I saw on there when I opened my last bank statement and I I didn't recognize the charge. So I actually wanted to dispute that charge but here I am not being able to find my account information. am I able to do these stuff online? Do you know? Once I find it. So I don't have to callback and wait on hold.", "Adam and Eves! I have never even been to that kind of store. What. That OK. I'm the only one with this card and I did not go to that store and I know my husband does not have my card and he did not go to that store so I know that store is not. Nope nope. No. That is not my purchase I. No, we're recording right now. How do I get rid of this? I want my money back now.", "Right, exactly. I tried to go online on you know, on my. On the on the bank account online And expand it to see if I could find any information. I didn't see a telephone number and I don't recognize the company. I did try to Google it but I still didn't recognize that company at all so I. I definitely need you know, need to have that removed cuz that wasn't something I charged.", "Yeah I don't. I. I just know what I thought it was cuz it was. It was odd cuz we made a purchase but. But the dollar amount did not match up. We made a purchase for two thousand. Like around two thousand dollars but the purchase it came back for like around thirty-five hundred dollars and I was like OK, did did we miss miss something that was charged more than. Than. Than what we thought?", "It's one hundred and fifty-three dollars and eleven cents. it looks like it's like a some sort of tech company. when I try to look it up online I couldn't find a telephone number for the company to contact them It didn't look like it was based out of the US. So I'm not sure but I just wanted to call you guys and dispute it coz I know that I haven't used any services from any type of company like this.", "Hi, this is Laura Winters and I I'd like to know what kinds of credit cards you have. Other bank that I have has a terrible fraud department. They are so hard to work with. They couldn't resolve a credit dispute that I had. It was fraud from another state! Another state! I haven't been out of state in at least three years. And yet they couldn't resolve it with their credit their with their fraud department. Just makes me spit nails.", "So I really want to dispute a charge that is on my card. I called earlier to see monies had been credited back to my account for a purchase that I made and returned, but it hasn't been credited. and it was purchase that I made on eBay and I I sent the item back to the seller, but they have not returned my funds and I know that they have received it because I got return. Like a return postage on it so that I know that they got the item back already.", "No, I definitely did not. I do not live in California. I've not visited California, and I called this place to see if perhaps they were like an online merchant, like you know maybe I'd bought something and forgot. but they don't sell anything online. I have wracked my brain, I've asked my husband. I have tried and tried to figure out where this charge could have come from but the only thing I can figure out is that someone's stolen my account information.", "sure. It's for ninety-seven dollars and fifteen cents. it looks like, based on what I'm seeing online, it was charged to my account on September second and the the company name looks like it says Tech dash N O. but I don't I don't recognize the name and I've never seen this company or I definitely didn't charge anything for this amount. I don't know. Does it say on your end what like any any more information about the company, maybe where it's from or anything or a telephone number maybe?", "Well, I was doing all right until I got my credit card statement in the mail and I was looking and on my transactions I I'm seeing a transaction on the twenty-ninth of September from Apple for the amount of two thousand four hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents and I did not make that. So I've looked around for my credit card. I can't find it anywhere. I don't I guess maybe the last time I used it, I might have left it on the counter or dropped it somewhere. I don't know what happened.", "well I was calling because I was looking on my account earlier today and I've and maybe I'm just like overthinking it but I seen a transaction that I I didn't recognize and you know I was I was out of town last week so I think like maybe it's possible that like I used it my card or something and I couldn't remember. I don't know but I just feel like it's not something that I had you know something that I had done so, I don't know, I was just hoping that maybe you could give me some insight as to like what this transaction was.", "Hi, yeah this is Barry Allen yeah I have a I'm seeing a purchase on my transaction history for over three hundred for three hundred dollar over three hundred dollars for two new tires from Walmart I did not get two new tires. Now I've called before. Because I saw a transaction but it just for for for some groceries and I and I didn't think much of it. I thought, OK, someone got my info and you guys sent me a new card, so but I know card changed anything. But now, it's happened again, I'm assuming in the same and it's in the same area. So did you guys not change my info? On y'all's end?", "Oh, no, that's OK. I yes, there is something else I do want to I wanted to do. I was trying to do it online and as I said, I was having an issue. I saw a charge out there for a service that was not rendered. it was actually for something that was supposed to be scheduled and it was wasn't rendered the person it was a charge from Home Depot and the person never came out to fix my dishwasher. And I called them and they said they were going to reverse the charge and they still haven't and so I want to dispute that through you guys because they are not taking care of removing the charge from my my account.", "Oh OK. It was for a hundred and sixty-four dollars and it was last week. And now I mean I I don't remember exactly what day it was, is last week I think it was a. When I went to eat, I I went to eat at Chinese restaurant and you know how sometimes a Chinese restaurant they'll take your your credit card back into the kitchen and they was a long time bringing it back out. And they brought it back out from the kitchen. and that was. That was last week and I. Have you had something like that happen to you? I mean I I don't really know I I don't really like the idea of anybody taking my credit card back there. Does that. Does that happen to you?", "It was the Hamden Inn. I mean I recognize the the hotel, it's just that they weren't supposed to charge me and I have tried to reconcile it with them and they haven't gotten back to me. I've contacted them three separate times and still it's been, you know, since the middle of last month or excuse me, the previous month. It's even October now. So it's been over a month you know since that date and once I saw all that on my statement last month I contacted them and I've contacted them like I said three times and they haven't gotten back to me. So I just want to you know, have you all remove it and then you know, that way I don't have to even wait on them any longer."]}

I got a mailer in the Mail For a credit card that you're offering can you give me any information on that?", "Oh so in that case then that mean I can also use my my former credit card or will I need to also get the new credit for the new account?", "Sure. No problem. actually I have another question for you. can you tell me what kind of credit cards are available through Intellibank?", "All right. OK. I just wanna know, last question, Peter, I'm thinking about traveling, hopefully. Soon and can I can I use my travel card?", "So if there is any balance on the card after, if it's gets stolen, will that automatically transfer over to a new traveler traveler card?", "Oh perfect that that matches it can is it possible to do my credit card, what I owe my credit card too right now or do I have to call back?", "OK what about my subscriptions that I have tied to that card? Will I need to contact them and and get it updated card on file for them also?", "How long is going to take to get the card and when I get it am I going to have the same credit card number or it's going to be a different one?", "So if I cancel the card, and then I happen to find it, like if I find it then, then I can't use it again, right? Like it's gone, I can't use it anymore.", "yeah. I I I was just wondering because I'm going to be doing some traveling overseas and wasn't quite sure the differrences between your different cards.", "Hi Lisa. I was calling about the travelers card that you guys offer. And I was curious as to how it's different than the other credit cards you guys have.", "Just telling me of these credit cards that you offer. I was just curious as to what the difference is between the two different offers for the credit card", "actually, since I'm not in front of the computer, could you please check and tell me what was the last charge on my debit card? Just wanna make sure that.", "Get my money back? I want my money back now. And I. How do I get rid of this? Who has my card? I only have one card. Can people make duplicates of my card?", "No, I was just trying to make sure that it came off the account and that by you canceling my card it wouldn't like cause that transaction to be voided out.", "So I don't mean to sound like an idiot but but what do I do? Do I just take the card and use it? Or do I have to have like a code or whatever to put in it?", "Yeah, sorry about that. actually, I got an email about changing my current credit card to a cash back card. and I was interested in switching to that if possible.", "Oh, OK. Perfect. hey, while I have you on the phone I notice that my new debit card has not came in the mail. And I just kinda wanted to see like what was going on.", "Like Like I mean seriously. Like. They they steal the card. How how much do they think they can get. Because they gotta figure the person's going to cancel the card.", "and first though, if it's OK, my friend was telling me about a money-back card that you guys have. Would you be able to give me a little bit of information about that?", "So just a couple of so there has been a couple of charges that I do not remember. Could I just go ahead and get a new card sent out to me and just get this as you know.", "yeah yeah while I have you on the phone my friend was telling me about the money-back card that you guys have. Could you give me a little bit of information about that?", "No. No I think you've done everything I needed to do today. I really appreciate it. Oh. Oh actually is is there anything more I need to do. What if someone used my card?", "Is there a way maybe possibly pay you know, like a fee of some sort to maybe get the card within twenty-four hours as of. I am needing to use it within the next day or two.", "Now what are you gonna do to stop. Cuz what if this person still has my number or is making purchases, am I. Can I still use my card or you. What are you gonna do to stop this?", "OK. will I still be able to. I mean, with the card locked, will I still be able to at least make one or two payments online or am I gonna have to go wait until the new card comes in?", "Yes, please. and while you're at it I'm just curious on how long it will take to do this because I really have somewhere else to be and after you do it when will I be receiving my card?", "Well no, I mean that that purchase was definitely made by me and more than likely I may have just lost it so re-issuing I think would be fine. Do you think that would be a good course to take?", "So can I just get a card with the same number? I had that solved in all my accounts so that that's how I pay things. It's all saved in there so I don't really want to change it unless I have to.", "Now are you gonna give me a chip card because all the other cards that I've got in the past were chip were not a chip card. They're just a scan card so I think the chip cards are a lot more security.", "OK. That's good because I did lose the card and I haven't been able to find it. So, that will make is so no one can use the card. Is that correct or do I need to go through a whole new process with that?", "Yeah, actually I lost my debit card while I was here, which is why I'm transferring money into her account. So, she can just let me use her card and give me cash from the ATM. So, I need to cancel my card.", "Well, I can't find it so it's either either I left it somewhere or I miss. I It's not around. I I haven't used it in a while so I'm not anyhow. I'd like to. I like. I can't find the card so I'd like to close it.", "I would possibly be interested in a credit increase but definitely not at this time. I'll go ahead and just pay down some of this amount and then I can give you guys a call for a credit limit increase on this credit card.", "hi Sara. I tried to make a purchase just now and my card was declined. It said insufficient funds. Which I don't understand because I know I have enough money in my account. I just used the card too online and had no problems.", "You know what, it's fine. It's fine. I I I got it I wrote it down. I wrote it down. It's fine. OK. I'm keeping track of this. If this happens again, it's your ass. OK. so what are you gonna do? Are you gonna send me a new card?", "OK, so that really wouldn't be one to have for like a one time thing. I was just looking for something that I could put like a little extra money on and put it aside for this wedding. Do you have any other type of card that that might?", "I was down at Advance Auto and I had to get an auto part, and it was. It kept declining my card, and I knew I had around three thousand something dollars in there, so I just need to need to see what's going on, make sure everything's OK.", "Yeah, Amber. This is Robert Johnson. I I'm at the grocery store and for some reason my card keeps on saying can't like it's a like a reading error? I keep on putting the chip in and then it's not reading it or something is what the lady's trying to tell me.", "Well if I do that though will whoever has my card if it was stolen can they keep making the payment making charges until I get that new card or are you going to shut it off? Or still gonna be active if I do find it before I get the new card? What's gonna happen?", "yes I can't find any stores around here that would give me money off my credit card. Do you know any places that I can go to that would get me money off this card. you know what never mind. Just give me some addresses to some local branches I'll just find one myself.", "OK. Well, that's fine. I mean, I understand that but, what about the meantime? Like will I get my money back or, you know, what about the card itself? You'll send me a new card or or can't use my card for thirty days, my account cancel ? And what what's going on with that?", "No. I mean I have both of my cards right here, so that's why it's really confusing to me. I don't honestly like soon maybe file a report if needed or cancel one of the card that it was. The card number that was used. I'm kind of worried that this might be might happen again.", "I think I might have said it wrong. So what I mean is like you know those Visa cards that I've gotten for like the holiday's and stuff. Their Visa cards and you can put money on them and like you can use them everywhere. I'll there might be a fee or something to put the money on them.", "Yes. I was actually wondering about the you know I travel a lot and I have my gold card with me but I don't know why it doesn't really work. The gold card. Is it. Is there any other card that I'm maybe. I'm. I don't know. I. I'm, I'm using my gold card for my traveling, is. Is that all right?", "Wait, I'm sorry. You know what? I have a few cards that look alike. I might have put the wrong PIN number in. have another, another thing that you can help me with if you can. to check the balance of my bank account. I need to do a large order. And I wanted to make sure I had enough to cover the order.", "Yeah. It it wasn't an issue until recently. Oh you know what I I just remembered, never mind, it's not the card actually. The restaurant where I go for lunch everyday has a faulty chip reader. That's right, they told me that. I was thinking it was the card, sorry, but it's not. I'd like to keep the card I have.", "Awesome. I think that should be good for when I go to the store. do have another question to ask you. not sure I can't remember exactly but is there any money back or something like that on the card? that I'm gonna be using? And in case there is do you know like how much I get back and when the money gets I guess put into my account?", "OK. But that's my debit card and I think now the debit card is empty and your s~. Because, I mean, I should not really having that much money in my bank account I guess. Because it's over four thousand dollars and it's debit card, so those money are real money, you know, so it's gone. So, when can I have real money back into my account.", "We'll the one thing I do want to find out. I I mean, you're helping me already with this location. But I keep hearing about a travel card, a travel card, a travel card. What what actually is it really worth it? Is is it a good thing? I keep hearing great things about it. I do a lot of traveling. Will it benefit me at the end of the day?", "I would like to go ahead. Can we can we lock that? Can we go ahead and just send me a new card because I'm thinking somehow. I mean I've got I've got the card on my person, but I'm unable to use my I couldn't use my card or credentials to get into to my app, and I had that stuff saved so I'm thinking that somehow someone got my password or something.", "Oh, while you're doing that, let me tell you, I am so excited about getting this debit card right away because I have some orchids that I need to buy some supplies for. And one of them just started a new bloom spike. And I need to get some fertilizer so that I can make sure they keep blooming. And well, listen to me go on. Do you like orchids of growing plants?", "Well that's fine. I just. I want the card shut off. I don't want it. I don't want people using it to buy money buy stuff and. And I don't want to lose all my money. And I I just paid it down. I need it done now. I'm trying to go on vacation and. This is not something that I can handle right now. What can you. Can you stop it from getting used from where you are?", "OK. Yep, that makes sense. Great. I really appreciate you doing this for me. Now I can remember what it was. I did have one more question though. I'm going out of town, and I was wondering if I can give you like the city I'm going to that way my credit card doesn't get frozen. I'm gonna be travelling to Michigan. So if you could just put that some place if you can, that way when you sees things going in Michigan, I won't get that."]}

I came to North Carolina to see my sister but I can't find an Intellibank ATM anywhere. Can you help me?", "well, do you think that maybe you could help find me an ATM over near where he lives. I'll just ride over there and take out the cash and give it to him instead of trying to transfer it to his account. and I'll probably end up finding that paper when I come back from doing all that.", "yeah, I also had the I wanted to check about some ATMs cuz we moved again for the third time this year. We ended up moving up on Blade Mountain up on Farley Hollow, just I want to know closest ATMs in that area are and do they offer the cash deposit, do they offer the ITM and all that stuff.", "let, let, let alone not only the bank, an ATM, to get some money out. And I don't wanna use any other ATMs, because there's fees and, I mean, it's not worth it. On top of it I'm spending gas. So I don't know. I'm just thinking what to do if, if I should just I think I'm gonna close this account.", "Hi Mark. Actually well I would tell you the whole story. I wanted to go to buy a gift for my brother. And in this store they told me that they did they didn't accept credit cards so well now I have to find an ATM near me. And can you tell me where there is one located and also do they have a service fee?", "OK. Yes sir well that'd be just great Intellibank. Go right in there cause I don't wanna do ATM. I I mean I don't know when does it post up with the ATM? Maybe it post up today and and maybe not. But, what I wanna do is make sure that it gets I get this deposit posted today. Because like I said I may have over spent down at the battlefield.", "Now now another thing I was wondering like I I saw your signs on some of the ATMs but I was wondering like what what ATMs have different services I I saw two of them just within three miles of the house. The one do they have the ITM? what do they call it? Inter Interactive, the interactive teller? Where if I push a button I could talk to somebody.", "well, I just wanna complain again because the ATM that is down the street where I lived every time I go it is either out of order, or there is not substantial you know, funds in it. And I and I could just never used it. What is it that just everybody goes in there and just takes the money out time I need like forty dollars there is just like nothing?", "So know if I it is is is totally good for for me. But another big question is can I make a deposit. Because I noticed a few times I've gone, and I don't know if it was like ATMs I went to that were not Intellibank ATMs that I couldn't make a deposit, or will I be able to make a deposit? I need to make a. Make a deposit and a withdrawal at the same time today.", "I do have your online banking, but since I moved I don't have my internet set up yet at the house. So soon as I do I'll be able to access that again. And it shouldn't be a problem. Now now at your at your ATMs, do you have the the where you can put cash in. Can you deposit cash through the machine like some some of them used to do when I lived in Saint Saint Albans?", "Oh, OK. well I do have a question. I appreciate those and yes they are close to me, but is there anyway you either have something closer? Can I or can I use my card at a different bank, as I do apologize I don't have a car at the moment it kinda broke down and I'm a single mother of a two year old and a five year old, and I don't have a lot of extra cash to try to fix the car right now.", "no. That's that's all that's good. I'm gonna wait for the rain to to stop. Actually hold on. Do you think it would be a good idea, before I go to the ATM cause I know how you know all these people you know they look at you watch you push buttons and then they take your money out. I should probably know how much money I have in my account before I got to the ATM you think that's a good idea?", "I am I'm calling because I need to locate a branch near me.
