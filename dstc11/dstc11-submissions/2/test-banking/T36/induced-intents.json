So I want you guys to call them and get my money back, please.", "Things have been really really difficult and, you know, we've been we've been trying to hold onto this savings account, but you know, it's becoming more expensive cuz we're getting charged when our balance is below, you know, the hundred dollars so, we we just can't afford it right now. So we have to cancel it and I'm hoping. I think there's like fifty-two dollars or something like that in there and I'd like to transfer that over to to my checking as well.", "Now what are you gonna do to stop. Cuz what if this person still has my number or is making purchases, am I. Can I still use my card or you. What are you gonna do to stop this?", "Yeah.

And I was, I was really calling and fretting over that because I, I, I know is was, that accounts been negative for a while. I was trying to figure out was I was I blessed to not get charged or something?", "So I, I made a deposit where at deposit machine. So it was of fifty dollars and while receiving the and I got forty-eight dollars and I don't know why that happened. So I think I need clarification about that. So how do you explain that?", "OK so, there's something off on my account balance. Like it is way less than it should be and I I can't figure out why, and I I couldn't get into my my mobile app. so I I that's why I'm calling. I just gotta figure out what's wrong with the account.", "The savings account, it the fees. It look like you guys are raising the fee next month I don't know what is going on. why are you guys raising the fee? And how did this happen? Nobody notify me about this.", "I cannot believe it. So many bad things keep happening to me. I lost my job. My dog isn't eating properly. And I have to pay my bill within one day.", "yes. I just received my Intel savings account statement and I'm questioning the fee that's being charged each month. It looks like I'm being charged a five dollar fee and I just want to know what that's about.", "Yes. I was just curious as to why I'm being charged a five-dollar fee on a savings account?", "I got an issue with my bank account. Now I'm operating your financial institution. My account is frozen. I was expecting money from someone. I don't know if .", "Yeah I don't. I. I just know what I thought it was cuz it was. It was odd cuz we made a purchase but. But the dollar amount did not match up. We made a purchase for two thousand. Like around two thousand dollars but the purchase it came back for like around thirty-five hundred dollars and I was like OK, did did we miss miss something that was charged more than. Than. Than what we thought?", "Hey Kim. How you doing? I'm a customer of your bank and I have a well I guess that I have a problem but the bigger problem my wife has and I need to help get her problem situated because she's in a little bit of trouble.", "Hey Christina. How you doing? I I got a letter in the mail yesterday from your bank. And I kinda think I know what the issue is but it says there's a problem with my account. I was wondering if we can get this solved today?", "OK. Is there any other way? If I see another dispute, is there any other way to handle it other than calling you, as I'm doing now?", "All right. Good. If they do take anything out will I be reimbursed?", "Hi this is Laura Winters, I called a few days ago about paying bills from my account but there seems to be a problem doing that, so I'm calling back to figure it out.", "OK. So here's the thing I was down over at the. What was that the lucky silver Yeah the lucky Silver. Anyways I got to talking to Bob and Frank and they were talking and stuff and anyways I go out to talking about like savings rates and interest rates and like inflation basically we got started on this and I'm kind of preparing for like an economic downfall or something I can't remember it was a long conversation but I'd like to close my savings account.", "Hi, Joe. I called last week and I wanted to check my checking account balance and they said it was nine hundred dollars but when I checked today it was six hundred and I wanted to see what happened. What was the difference.", "No it's one of my savings accounts. Yeah I have it in there and I had to take some money out of it a couple of months ago for a little bit of an emergency and you have to keep a certain minimum balance in there and I don't have that minimum balance you guys keep charging me every month a fee and I haven't been able to bring it back up passed the minimum balance so I just want to close the account and transfer that money into another account that I have that you guys don't charge any fees.", "It's actually to my credit card. I saw it the other day and I need to have it taken off, please.", "Yes, and it's one that I didn't do. So I want it taken off my account, please.", "So yes let's check the balance and while you're doing it please take a look to see if there's any indication or notice on in of some sort of issue. Whatever.", "yes that's acceptable. Maybe transfer a little bit more then to compensate for that fee. How much did you say it was again?", "I. Is it possible I talk to the fraud department right now?", "no. I I don't think so. That's it. this won't affect any of my other accounts that I have with Intellibank though, correct? Like it will all just remain separate and I just want to verify it's just this one account that we've discussed that's being closed.", "Well that's fine. I just. I want the card shut off. I don't want it. I don't want people using it to buy money buy stuff and. And I don't want to lose all my money. And I I just paid it down. I need it done now. I'm trying to go on vacation and. This is not something that I can handle right now. What can you. Can you stop it from getting used from where you are?", "well, I have automatic deposit of some things. but and then. Well, I guess I'll have to change that because I have my electric bill deducted and now it'll be a different company. So, I guess I have to change that. Let's see I had the telephone deducted, so I guess I'll have to change that.", "good question. So we just moved recently so do you know they were charging. They were charging. Well, I already know our rent was expensive. Do you know they were gonna raise our rent two hundred dollars a month?", "Awesome. I think that should be good for when I go to the store. do have another question to ask you. not sure I can't remember exactly but is there any money back or something like that on the card? that I'm gonna be using? And in case there is do you know like how much I get back and when the money gets I guess put into my account?", "But it is what it is. So OK, I'll go ahead and and pay that fee so that I can do this. Now what were the things that you said you needed from me?", "I have been trying to get my bank to cancel my membership for the longest time and every time that they say that they are going to close it, they never do, and I am charged again. And the money is never reimbursed. And I've been dealing with this problem for a really long time. so I have no idea how to go about getting this handled."]}

Like a a travel card or something?", "No sorry I I didn't bring anything with me today. Is there any other way we can do it?", "I really hope you can help me.

Would you be able to give me a little bit of information about that?", "I. I would have loved to. How do I go about it?", "OK, that's good. That is good. Now what is the online process? Could you explain it?", "OK I'm gonna need to be ordering. Ordering some checks pretty soon. can I do that online, or can you do that for me, or how do I do that?", "Do I have security on my account? Like if for some reason it was someone not correct. Can they get into my account? Or do you guys provide that kind of security?", "Would it be better for me to come to the local branch and talk to somebody there? Kinda to understand what papers I need to gather and where my finances needs to be or over the phone? What do you recommend?", "No, can you help me find one please?", "I'm I'm not sure if I wanted checking or saving. Can you go more into detail about what to do?", "Six and a half, OK. That's not too bad. All right and is that something you you could assist me with, or would I need to speak to somebody else?", "OK. Do they need an ID or anything for that?", "Huh. Now how. I don't have access to to that kind of thing online. Can we talk about how to make that happen?", "No, I'm sorry sir. I mean I'm asking can I activate it online?
