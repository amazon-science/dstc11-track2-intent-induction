And I don't know where it is, what happened. The last time I used it was at yesterday's breakfast then I don't know if I didn't get the card back. I asked. We usually go to the same place and I asked them while we were there and my card was not recovered there or found or anything so I'm not sure what the next step to do here or the process. Do I close my account? Should I I I think like in my head already which I'm thinking I wanna transfer some of my money out of my account to make sure I'm safe so. can you like instruct me what to do next?", "So I was just thinking. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and you know like I said fourth of July is coming up this weekend. And we all know once fourth of July hits, Christmas is around the corner. And when I was a kid my my aunt and my everybody in my family, my mom and everybody but my aunt would organize it every year. She used to call it, it was she would set up Christmas club accounts for us. I wanna get. I wanna set up I don't know if they still call it that or whatever, but I want to set up an account and this way every week, I can just you know go and transfer money from from my one account to this new account. This way I have money come you know which I'll probably wait till the last minute to do my Christmas shopping. So this way I can get you know my wife and my kids and my you know I have grandkids. I can be ahead of the curve financially and ready to make all those nice purchases.", "You see you see this is what I don't like about you people. You you guys know how to do things to people that how can you tell me that my I have to have an account? My account I can't access my money because it's this and that. Why do you have to do that? You see why I don't trust bank bank people. I don't really trust bank people because the the this whole thing right now is so annoying right now. Is so pissed I'm pissed of right now. But you know I have so much money I have to keep it somewhere. That's why I'm I'm trying to get a new bank cuz you know, the whole thing, the whole banking system is well, my friend told me about your bank. So I want to give it a try but but I'm really I'm not I'm not I'm not impressed right now. You know, because your interest rate and whatever you told me you know, I think I'm let me just let me just go for the savings account. Let me go for the savings account and let's see how it goes from there.", "OK well like I said, I'm a carpenter. And so I've got I've got my personal account and then I got my business account and usually I make my business expenses all out of the business account. My personal expenses I keep separate for tax purposes and and what have you, but I'm involved in this real big job that I haven't got paid on yet. But I'm gonna be paid on it real soon. And so I guess what I am trying to say is I need to kind of loan myself or loan the business some money temporarily cuz I got I got payroll coming up and I got some real good workers for me. I don't know if you ever worked, you know this type of construction but they work hard and they need to get paid on time and so, so what I'm gonna do since the business account is running short, is I wanna loan myself some money, or am loan the business some money. And so, that's that's why I'm saying this I try need to try to get twenty-five hundred dollars out of my personal account and into my business account is basically what I I'm kind of a personal loan is what I'm saying, or a business loan from from my personal account."]}

It was a spent mortar shell that somebody had collected from there and several bullet fragments from the mini balls and a it was really really really fine fine day.

The actual reason that I'm calling is, I'm trying to find a branch near me . The apartment that we were living in, we had a branch that was right around the corner, all I had to do if I need to go to the bank was walk out the door and there we were."]}

I have a charge on it that I don't recognize. so I'd like to dispute this this charge that I have on the statement.", "Yeah so I checked my credit card account balance and I noticed there were some charges that just did not look familiar. I don't remember making those charges and I just wanted see if there is anything that we could do or you can help me.", "Hello, I'm trying to see why there are some charges on my account that I know nothing about. I'm trying to understand what that's for and if you can help me with any information that'll be great. I believe that they are on my travel credit card.", "OK. Yes, but I also noticed something. I have a some charges here on my phone. from from my accounts. You know, I just found out that you guys have been charging me. I don't know what's this charge is all about you know, so can you explain that to me, please?", "yes, I'm calling about a memo I received in the mail about a account I have with your bank that I haven't used in a very long time. And they're telling me that if I don't use it or if it stays inactive I'm gonna be charged some fees. Can you help me with that?", "Oh, I'm sorry. June twentieth. twenty twenty-one. I have two charges. They're exactly the same for fourteen dollars and ninety-nine cents to a company called Robux. I did make one of those purchases, but they charged me twice. So I need to have that second one taken off.", "I'm doing great. Thank you. I have a a statement here and I am looking at a transaction that I don't recognize. I am looking at the the date and who is charging as well as the amount and I definitely don't recognize any of this. And I was wondering if you could help me with that.", "the last one that I made I purchased gas at Wawa for thirty-five dollars. but I did see two purchases that I don't recognize. And one of them is at Walmart for two hundred thirty-five dollars and there's one at Target for three hundred and fifty dollars. Can I dispute those charges?", "I imagine. well Rose, I need some help. I am looking at my statement, I just received it in the mail and I see a charge on here that I don't recognize. the date of the charge Oh, I'm sorry. You probably need some information to pull up my account first. I'll let you go through all all of that.", "Hi Rose. My name is Kim. I need some help please with a transaction that I don't recognize. I am looking at my statement and I I'm not recognizing the this charge or this company. so I need some help with that and then I also want to transfer some money from my my checking to my savings account.", "yes. So I am looking here. I have a double charge on my credit card. It's for fourteen ninety-nine on on June twentieth from a company called Roebucks. I am fine with one charge but they charged me twice for the same exact thing. So I'm gonna need that to be disputed and like delete it. I don't wanna pay it twice.", "That's hilarious. Well, Rose. I called today about I need a couple of things actually. I need to close my savings account that I have with you all. and I also had a charge show up on my checking account that I need to check check check with you guys cuz I don't recognize that and I would like to dispute the charge.", "no, but I do need to dispute a charge on my checking account. the, you know, the same account number that you just deposited the money into. there was a charge on September seventeenth. for twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents. from a company that I didn't recognize. it just says T Y B L. so I I I did wanna dispute that charge.", "Yes, ma'am. That's correct, and the charge that I did not make. It was made the following day it seems. for almost two thousand dollars with Microsoft. Well, one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents And definitely did not make that, although I really could use a new computer. But it's not a good time", "Yes. Not really like a transaction but I'm seeing charges going out of my phone. so so I don't know cuz I've not done any transaction yet. But . I don't know, this charge is going out of my phone. I really don't know what the charges are for because you have not given me my my. I've not got my card yet, so what are these charges for?", "OK so on June twentieth I have on June twentieth I was charged twice is is really what happened. I was charged fourteen ninety-nine twice by a company called Robux. I did want one of the charges. I did authorize one of the charges but that company has charged me twice for the same exact thing. So I need to get that disputed and deleted.", "so I have received so. First of all, I don't shop really online and I don't know where this charge is coming from. So, I have never bought anything from them. I call them they said that they can't find me in the system, but they have not re-returned my money. from from my credit card. So I want you guys to call them and get my money back, please.", "I'm doing pretty good. I have a question for you. I was looking at my statement that I just received in the mail for the charges for last month and I see something on here that I don't recognize. that I don't recognize the amount or the the company that's charging me, so I'd like to actually dispute that transaction. I was wondering if you could help me with that.", "Yes and then I actually in addition to that had a charge that I saw on there when I opened my last bank statement and I I didn't recognize the charge. So I actually wanted to dispute that charge but here I am not being able to find my account information. am I able to do these stuff online? Do you know? Once I find it. So I don't have to callback and wait on hold.", "Right, exactly. I tried to go online on you know, on my. On the on the bank account online And expand it to see if I could find any information. I didn't see a telephone number and I don't recognize the company. I did try to Google it but I still didn't recognize that company at all so I. I definitely need you know, need to have that removed cuz that wasn't something I charged.", "Yeah I don't. I. I just know what I thought it was cuz it was. It was odd cuz we made a purchase but. But the dollar amount did not match up. We made a purchase for two thousand. Like around two thousand dollars but the purchase it came back for like around thirty-five hundred dollars and I was like OK, did did we miss miss something that was charged more than. Than. Than what we thought?", "So I really want to dispute a charge that is on my card. I called earlier to see monies had been credited back to my account for a purchase that I made and returned, but it hasn't been credited. and it was purchase that I made on eBay and I I sent the item back to the seller, but they have not returned my funds and I know that they have received it because I got return. Like a return postage on it so that I know that they got the item back already.", "No, I definitely did not. I do not live in California. I've not visited California, and I called this place to see if perhaps they were like an online merchant, like you know maybe I'd bought something and forgot. but they don't sell anything online. I have wracked my brain, I've asked my husband. I have tried and tried to figure out where this charge could have come from but the only thing I can figure out is that someone's stolen my account information.", "sure. It's for ninety-seven dollars and fifteen cents. it looks like, based on what I'm seeing online, it was charged to my account on September second and the the company name looks like it says Tech dash N O. but I don't I don't recognize the name and I've never seen this company or I definitely didn't charge anything for this amount. I don't know. Does it say on your end what like any any more information about the company, maybe where it's from or anything or a telephone number maybe?", "Oh, no, that's OK. I yes, there is something else I do want to I wanted to do. I was trying to do it online and as I said, I was having an issue. I saw a charge out there for a service that was not rendered. it was actually for something that was supposed to be scheduled and it was wasn't rendered the person it was a charge from Home Depot and the person never came out to fix my dishwasher. And I called them and they said they were going to reverse the charge and they still haven't and so I want to dispute that through you guys because they are not taking care of removing the charge from my my account.", "It was the Hamden Inn. I mean I recognize the the hotel, it's just that they weren't supposed to charge me and I have tried to reconcile it with them and they haven't gotten back to me. I've contacted them three separate times and still it's been, you know, since the middle of last month or excuse me, the previous month. It's even October now. So it's been over a month you know since that date and once I saw all that on my statement last month I contacted them and I've contacted them like I said three times and they haven't gotten back to me. So I just want to you know, have you all remove it and then you know, that way I don't have to even wait on them any longer."]}
