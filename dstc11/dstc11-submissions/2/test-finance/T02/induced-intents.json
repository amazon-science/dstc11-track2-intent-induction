I my my brother's in town who's visiting and he he tried to clean my office to be nice and and he he just misplaced it and don't you hate it when you have people come over and like they touch things and then stuff is out of place and then so so now I can't it so, so here I am talking to you trying to find out about my quick liquidity ratio.

I looked at my savings account, I checked the balance, the withdrawals, the fees, the transactions. I compared them and contrast them. These are from my business accounts, they're not. I do my personal banking somewhere else. And then I did have some sort of term loan I took out a while back, and I know the percentage on the term loan had increased over time. And then I put that. I kind of have, like a method I use so. I looked at the checking, I looked at the savings, I looked at the term loan and like all three of those things are really my finances with you. So I was trying to figure out, like. Those are separate, and I have, like I've made investments using money out of my checking, out of my savings, using a loan, so. I, I've, I've funded investments in a number of different ways. Like if I had to do it again, I'd probably try to just use one account, but I used a bunch of different accounts. And I was kinda clicking around your website, and couldn't find something that maybe consolidated that. Maybe it's just me, cuz I haven't used the website that much. But I dunno. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way I can get all that information in, in, into one thing? Does. Is. You guys do that? Does that make sense?", "Yeah, I'm an Intellibank customer and I'm trying to complete a financial analysis for my business, and I need to put together a business portfolio, and was wondering if someone could help me with that?", "Is it?
