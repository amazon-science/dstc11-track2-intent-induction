These people are really callous. It's upsetting that in, in the day they said I signed my name to a waiver, and so they have no liability to it, and now they're charging me for the costs of this, this bouncy castle that's coming in roughly, I guess, twelve hundred dollars on top of medical bills. So I've a crying daughter, an upset wife a son that's telling me that I've ruined his birthday with this bouncy castle, and why does she get all the attention just because she broke her arm? it's it's, it's a lot. if anything you can do with it, just like help me have an understanding, this would add a little bit of peace of mind to my, to my week."]}

You know, like how do I let him know that like hey the money's in your account, like right now.", "OK. OK. I just wanna make sure there was no possible way that they could actually evict me before that got back in the mail. Looks like I'm good. Looks like if you mail it to me I'll still be here and they can't kick me out of this building and. Wow! Wow. This is crazy. I never thought this would happen. I thought this building would be around forever. I grew up in a house that my my mom still lives in. And you know you just think things are always gonna stay the same but only thing that stays the same is that things keep changing. Am I right?", "Hey, Jimmy, quick change needed here. No longer need the my my monthly statements delivered to my to my place. I probably should rather have it done I guess through through email that can be done with you. you know, things happen, new girlfriend. She's you know really cool conscious and she's just appalled by the fact that I get my statements every month from the bank versus I guess checking online or getting like a text about what the current amount is. I don't know. But anyways if there's if there's anything we can do to get that knocked out be super helpful.", "Fine. Look, dude, dude, you guys can't. If you if you could pass this on to your manager that you guys need to be more specific up front because it was so big to me. I thought you were gonna forward me to somebody right now and now you're telling me I gotta come in tomorrow and it's fine, I'll take the appointment tomorrow, I'll take whatever I can get. But this is so frustrating as a customer. In the future I would suggest if I was running that company, and trust me I've run many companies, that you tell me right away if we can do this now or later. OK? That's all I wanna say.", "I'm doing good, I'm doing very good and Got my mail today and I was going through it and cleaning through, and I came across mail. Piece of mail from your bank, and I almost thought it was junk mail but then I actually started reading it. And it really interested me and it's about the new app that Intellibank has. And I was saying to myself wow, that would just save me so much time in the course of the day with my business and me because I'm like a numbers guy, and I'm constantly checking balances. Well, calling to check my balance, or stop at an ATM to check my balance, and I figure this way if I just have it on my phone it would make my whole life so much easier.", "Kaleb, hi Kaleb. Oh man, I'm just I've been getting a lot of spam, just email spam, and I'm not I'm not very tech savvy. I always prefer I guess talking to someone live, but yeah like, I just been getting all this spam. I've been deleting it but I still get it. I don't know, and I also might wanna like update some information cuz I just moved as well, if I can update my my address, at least see if you guys. Maybe I I might have updated already, you see, I don't know. I got, I get this email from you guys and sometimes I respond and and sometimes it's spam. It looks like spam anyway. Sometimes I just delete it, so I think it's just a whole mess right now. I'm just trying to figure it all out.", "Santino? that's a great name, man. I am calling just because you know I've been a loyal customer of Intellibank for a long time. And you know, I run a a shipping company. And you know lately we've been just waiting for so much. So much of a, you know, wood shipments to come over from overseas. And because of the pandemic, everything is freaking blocked at, you know, at the Long Beach ports. And none of my furniture clients can get what they want. So, you know, all this wait is just making us, you know, spend so much on freaking admin costs. So, I was just wondering, you know, if what I could do about that? I mean, like how do I supplement my my, you know, my my loan costs and like make sure that I'm not going under?", "I'm doing good. Actually I am a customer of your bank. and just got home after a you know long day at the office. and going through the mail and sorting through the junk mail and the real mail and the bills that I don't want but I came across I I got this notice in the mail about you know different types of loans that Intellibank offers. I I was thinking. You know I've been teetering on the fence and thought it was that time to do some things with my business I've been wanting to do and putting off and the I didn't originally want to go the route of doing a loan but you know what? I think In the long run it's going to be the best option and investment for my business so I just wanted to go over use. I see there's like multiple types of loans and you know I do have the collateral that is needed. If need be. So I was wondering what type of loan you think would be best for me and my business."]}

I'm like it's in the fish tank. See, you're not laughing either, I know. It it was dumb jokes in a dumb time of my life. And anyway, whew man. What's wait, wait, wait, you're gonna, you're gonna email that to me or?", "Hi, this is Luis. And, I'm calling because I have a, well, I have a checking account with you. And I I was thinking of applying for a gold card next month, not not in a rush to do it right now, I'll probably due it next month. But I am considering getting an auto loan and then, I'm also thinking of starting a business, so I might want to expand and get a business account. And potentially get a SBA loan, but, before I do any of this, I I I would like to talk to a financial advisor. I've I've heard that you have a very good department of financial advisors. So, yeah, if I could get put into contact with with someone, I I'd love to set something up.", "So the reason for my call is last month I ended up getting a gold card for my business and great experiences with it so far and now now that we're expanding. We're approaching our busy season. I'm interested in getting an SBA loan for around a hundred thousand dollars. And I wanted to see you know. It would just make sense since I already have this card with you. We have a good thing going. I'd love to see if if if if we could just go ahead and add this this loan to my account. I mean I could go to another bank, but I'd like to like to keep things all under one roof, in house. I think that'd be, that'd be great for both of us so yeah could you just walk me through this just. I I think, I was looking for my net income, cuz on mine, I see that there asking for my net income, and and what I'm seeing online versus what I have. It's doesn't quite match up. So if you could just confirm my net income then I think I think I'm good to apply online, cuz I'm I'm pretty far in the application."]}

Well, how many days? And is it different from to get the you know to order the checks? Is there a tracker or anything like that and you know? how long is it gonna take them.", "I have a question. How long does it take to update any type of paid information. Like if I wanted to put another account on there to have this paid is that possible or does it take you know business days. Three five business of or payment solution.", "I mean, is there another. Can you give me another time just to compare like the beginning of my business? Like the the time period of when I first started to now just so I can compare to see if. You know, my husband really did make a difference with that, I guess?", "Yeah I left it in the ATM on accident and it I guess it eats it when you leave it there so no nobody can get ahold of it. and they said I have to get and get a new one set up, and it takes like ten days or something.

They're just not hot the way they used to be. You know, like during the there was kinda this throwback with the hot rods and whatnot, you know, but yeah, just with the chip shortage, tires, it's a bad business. So anyway I'm I'm gonna dissolve that one, but, like I said, I don't like I have money in that account, and I don't know if you should mail that to me, or if you should mail me a check, or if I could get that in bitcoin, or maybe ADA or something?", "Hey how are you Sampson? I need to cancel a check. Wrote it? Sent it? But it was the wrong amount. and this is kind of a very important client of mine and kind of what I have is sort of this immediate sense of professionalism. that wanted them to send in the check. Make the payment and it's too little it's wrong. I've already contacted somebody on their end. Who's you know, working with me to make sure they can intercept the check in time. but I'd also like there to be no no issues fumbling it. So hopefully that person doesn't say take the check cash it and then we had another whole issue we're going to have to deal with. I'd like to get in front of it. As well if that's if that's if that's able to happen."]}
