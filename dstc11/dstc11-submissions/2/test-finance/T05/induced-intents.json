We're approaching our busy season. I'm interested in getting an SBA loan for around a hundred thousand dollars. And I wanted to see you know. It would just make sense since I already have this card with you. We have a good thing going. I'd love to see if if if if we could just go ahead and add this this loan to my account. I mean I could go to another bank, but I'd like to like to keep things all under one roof, in house. I think that'd be, that'd be great for both of us so yeah could you just walk me through this just. I I think, I was looking for my net income, cuz on mine, I see that there asking for my net income, and and what I'm seeing online versus what I have. It's doesn't quite match up.

Excellent. Ok. I called the right place.

Was a seven year loan. I know we'd been been paying it back pretty steadily. since then. And it would have to be nearing towards the end. But then we had all these costs and we refinanced briefly and with you guys thankfully and you guys gave us a great rate I think we're still we're still, we're we're close. I know we're close we're paying over the principal every time we've been making those low payments. But now we were looking into making a little bit of a shift. You know. We've got these kids coming in and they're, they're, they're wonderful. We adopted two kids. We're just looking to be able to set them up as great as we can. So that's kinda what I'm looking at.

I think it's the the wealth management loan and my account I think has been violated or I don't know what term you guys use over there but I, I, I called before. The guy didn't help me out. Forget his name. I don't know if you guys have in the notes that, that somebody helped me before. But they didn't, like, so help me. I don't even know why I'm using that word. Anyway, my wealth management loan, which I was suppose to receive on the fifteenth, still hasn't processed. Twenty-second now So that makes you guys a week late.

Or, or, what, what, what, what's, what's happening?", "Hey Jenny, how you doing?

And, when will I know the payment went through?", "Oh, OK. And, how will I know it's been processed?", "No. I appreciate the help and yeah I'll will I get an email confirming that transaction?", "yes I have an Intel business total checking account and I have an outstanding check that has not been posted. It's been over a year and I would like to know if there's anything you can do about that?", "I did but I haven't been getting everything.

Now with the check, how long do they have to actually cash them, get that in, or is it, due by, due by somehow closing fee or, or anything like that, because I know some other companies they have a set time on certain things from", "Yes sir the credit card.

It's not due quite yet is it?", "yeah. Just is there thing missing? I feel like I'm signed up so quickly.", "Are you sure that you gave me a PIN number? I thought I had one but I don't know where it is. I'm at the office but it might be at home. Do you think you might have sent it to my home address or maybe you sent it here. You probably did send it here as this is where I get all my business mail. Maybe I brought it home but if I did, what did I do with it? Did I file it or did it get recycled? Did I even open it? I probably just put it in my briefcase meaning to read it at home and then it got mixed with a pile of other mail and I thought it was junk mail and tossed it out or maybe my wife tossed it out, I don't know. Are you sure you sent me one?", "I've been online and I'm not sure what's you know. I've I've been on hold for a little bit so just wondering you know how long is this gonna take.", "For sure. before could you confirm the amount that I have that's gonna be transferred?", "Perfect, perfect.

I did not receive my statement on my five hundred loan.", "OK, ninety sorry my OK, yeah and I just wanted to see if a check number went through yet. If you could check that for me.", "How long does it take for these for these cheques to be canceled on on average like once it's once its complete?", "And beginning of this transfer, how will I know it it's complete?", "I'm not so sure. I can't really remember which one is. Which one I use. But can I give both for you to verify which one is the one that is correct?", "And can you please make sure that that's added to my account?", "Oh that's good to know. So how long does it take for me to receive the confirmation that my money has been re-added back to my account?", "Hey Leslie. I need to This is my second time calling. I'm trying to I'm trying to add my mom to my account. and I called a week ago more than a week ago actually kinda like eight eight days ago to do this exact same thing and it hasn't gone through yet. So I don't know if it was something on my end that I did incorrectly or if it just takes time. To update the system. But it's been a long time. I feel like eight days is a long time so I don't know. I'm just calling to see to check up on that if it went through at all. yeah cuz I'd like to add my mom to my account please.", "Hey Robbie. just kind of going through everything looking through my information on my account and just I dunno something it seems to be missing. I made some charges, you know, as one does, and I'm not sure if they've gone through. And if they've gone through it's it's gonna be kind of big big issue with the house. Big issue with the house. We're doing some renovations and I'm just worried that that we're just not gonna have enough there to finish up. We're looking at this couch, which is beautiful couch, maybe a bit out of our range budget wise it's starting to stack up. I I I I dunno what else to say. trying to trying to make her happy, trying to do the right thing.", "Good. Look for some reason I don't know what the heck is going on but I I've not been getting my credit card balance bill", "OK great. while that's processing I just want to double check to make sure my my credit card hasn't expired. Do you mind if I go check on that?", "Great. But, I should get an email about the payment I just made?", "Yes ma'am, I sure am. The reason I'm calling is, I have an employee here who got his paycheck and he went to the bank to go and deposit it but when he got there, he could not find it anywhere and he has searched his car, he has searched his house, and he's checked his locker up here. And we have looked everywhere for it but it is gone apparently. So I guess what we're needing to do is cancel out that check so I can go ahead and re-issue him a new one.", "Hi, this is Peter Davis. I'm calling now for the third time about my Gold credit card. I called up two weeks ago, last week and now again and I still don't have any confirmation of it.", "I'm looking to try to get a bank statement here, you know I've been three, on hold for three hours I waited nicely, you guys finally answered the phone and now I'm not so nice, why? Three hours, think about it, three hours.", "Oh yeah. I had some problems with my my my camera and I've been and I have not been getting my statements.", "Now should I wait a certain amount of time before I write the new check and send that out, or can I go ahead and send that out today?", "right now I think I got a loan with you guys I I was concerned about that I don't know if that payment was made on time or not, just wanted to see.", "OK. is there anything pending on that account?", "And could I also get an email next week saying that I paid it off just so I can show my mother?", "And do you. Are you gonna need the check number that I wrote? And how long does it take to cancel the check, for it to go into effect?", "OK, and how long does it take for the, for the check to be stopped?", "OK, that's interesting. And can the app also do me a notification maybe when maybe there's a transfer or if these payments been done to my account?", "And and so essentially I received a statement in the mail the other day but I I got I misplaced it before I even opened it. And so I didn't get to see what my loan balance was.", "How long do these cancellations take? I mean I wrote this.", "I'm looking to get a loan statement because I've been with you guys for about four years now and it's just like sometimes off and on I don't receive my statement in the mail and it's it's a little disheartening I don't think anyone's stealing my mail so I'm just assuming that my account is falling through the cracks.", "Is there any way that you can log in into the account as like our new account that's being set up so we can be sure that it's you know we're on the same page and that it's actually being sent out this time cuz if you haven't changed anything in the account I'm not you know I'm not confident that I'm gonna all of a sudden be getting the mail regularly.", "OK, thank you for that. And also, how will I know that the payments went through?", "Well, to be honest I am not doing very well. To be honest with you, I'm extremely frustrated. I own Cashes Toy Store. and I sent a pretty, well a decent shipment out yesterday to one of our specialty vendors. And I just checked our balances online and they have not made their transfer. They were supposed to wire some money into our account to pay for that. And they have not done that yet. So the thing is, is I have already made or placed an order and and the funds for that should be coming out this afternoon. And I know that we do not have enough in our checking to cover that amount. So the reason I'm calling is to see is if when that payment does come out, will you guys automatically cover that from our savings or would that just bounce or or I mean what's gonna happen? I am I'm so aggravated right now. I don't think I'm gonna I don't think I'm gonna deal with this vendor anymore.", "And there has nobody, nobody has called in the last week?", "Hey Charles, I'm calling again because I'm having issues getting through I applied for a loan through you guys and it was two weeks ago and I haven't heard back. I don't I didn't receive any type of like a confirmation email or anything like that so maybe. We did get disconnected me and the person I was speaking to at the end so I think maybe I should've called back but I didn't so I assume it just never nothing nothing went through so I'm just tryna get this application in again with you if possible."]}
